# Kevin_NSS_Capstone

This capstone is a project that is important to me. I wanted to create something that combined my love for the environment and its biodiversity, with my love for traveling. So, I created what I simply call a "Sustainable Travel Guide". Essentially, I aimed to create a travel guide that focuses on providing interested users with environmentally conscious travel options that lists apt locations, their carbon emissions, biodiversity, transportation infrastructure, tourism statistics such as amount of tourists visiting and the average amount of money spent, etc. I hope that this project can be a useful source to anyone who wants to travel the world in a sustainable manner.
