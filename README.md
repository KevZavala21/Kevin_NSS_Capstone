## 1. Background

This capstone is a project that is important to me. I wanted to create something that combined my love for the environment and its biodiversity, with my love for traveling. So, I created what I simply call a "Sustainable Travel Guide". Essentially, I aimed to create a travel guide that focuses on providing interested users with environmentally conscious travel options that lists apt locations, biodiversity, tourism statistics such as amount of tourists visiting, and average gdp_percapita. I hope that this project can be a useful source to anyone who wants to travel the world in a sustainable manner.

## 2. Questions and Methods

The main focus of this guide that I created, is to give fellow environmentalists/travelers some direction for their future excursions. To do this, I needed extensive environmental and atmospheric data for the entire globe. NASA's dense online database thankfully had the data that I required to create something that I call an 'ecoRating'. This ecoRating will be a single number that is derived from several environmental factors and is weighted accordingly, specifically on whether the traveler is looking for a more rural/nature oriented vacation, or one in more urban conditions. To add onto this database, I also added a safety rating that was derived by a safety index provided by the Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP) This provides further valuable information for eco travelers, along with the most recent tourism visitor statistics for each country in the database. All of this combined will give travelers an idea of which countries are safe, free from over-tourism, and environmentally conscious.

## 3. Code and other work

The data I used came from several dense sources and they vary in complexity and depth. The most common type of data gathered were in the form of CSV files, which are usually already in tabular form and the files can be simply read into python, thus allowing them to be manipulated in python with relative ease. The process of cleaning all the datasets would be a long and arduous task. I had the option of cleaning the data either in Python or SQL. I opted to use Python/Pandas as I felt I was more in-tune with my Python skills. There are really only two notebooks of importance and that is the data_cleaning notebook and the fixed_dataframes notebook. These two notebooks are where a vast majority of the coding work was done in. I imported the final dataframes into Tableau and created my final dashboard, with a supporting presentation in powerpoint to provide some context on the scientific data.

## 4. Challenges

I had to narrow my scope and lower the ambitiousness of my project pretty early on in the process. I had hoped to include travel infrastructure into my capstone as a way to provide information on countries that have good public transportation options. I had also hoped to combine up to 8 different variables to create one definite ecoRating that encapsulates many different attributes of sustainable travel. I am sure this can be done later down the road as I continue to work on this project. What I do need to do is to markdown my python notebooks so it will be easier for interested parties to read.
