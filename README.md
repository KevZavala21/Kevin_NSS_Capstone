# Kevin_NSS_Capstone

This capstone is a project that is important to me. I wanted to create something that combined my love for the environment and its biodiversity, with my love for traveling. So, I created what I simply call a "Sustainable Travel Guide". Essentially, I aimed to create a travel guide that focuses on providing interested users with environmentally conscious travel options that lists apt locations, their carbon emissions, biodiversity, transportation infrastructure, tourism statistics such as amount of tourists visiting and the average amount of money spent, etc. I hope that this project can be a useful source to anyone who wants to travel the world in a sustainable manner. 

## Work that was done 

The data I used came from many different sources and they vary in complexity and depth. The most common type of data gathered were in the form of CSV files, which are usually already in tabular form and the files can be simply read into python, thus allowing them to be manipulated in python with relative ease. The process of cleaning all the datasets would be a long and arduous task. I had the option of cleaning the data either in Python or SQL. I opted to use both technologies as a means to sharpen my skills in both languages. At the very minimum, I hope to have neat and tidy enough databases that I can use to better visualize my findings eihter in Tableau or PowerBI, I have yet to decide which I would like to use.

## What I learned

Speaks for itself

## Trouble I Had

I already had to narrow my scope and lower the ambitiousness of my project. I hoped to do an eco-travel guide that users across the globe could use, but as of right now, I think I will have to focus mainly on the United States and close surrounding countries. As of right now, it is looking Like I will only be able to provide a database/guide that will be useful to travelers in the United States that are traveling domestically, or internationally. 

## Thank You
